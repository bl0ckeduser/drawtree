This is rough software for drawing trees.

It might be useful for e.g. debugging some code that deals with trees,
or to automatically generate pictures of trees built in a certain fashion.

Its dependencies are: Python 2.x and pygame

It takes its input as a single-line S-expression piped via stdin.
It outputs an image file specified by an argument. The supported
image formats are those supported by pygame, i.e. BMP, TGA, PNG, JPEG.

Here's an example invocation:

 echo '(1 (2 (3 a b c) 4 (5 6 7 (8 9) 10) (11 x)) z)' | ./drawtree.py test.png

There are some more samples in the "samples" directory. They can be
automatically built via the script "make-samples.sh".

Prufer code decoding 
====================

For general info on Prufer codes are, please see:

An example invocation is:

  cat prufer-samples/1.txt | ./prufer.py | ./drawtree.py test.png
